IDEA OF THE GAME:

- You are a nanorobot, tunneling downwards through a person, collecting their cancer.
- The game is played from a sideview perspective, where you are a robot moving downward, avoiding bones and collecting the colorfull cancer deposits.
- Sometimes there are blood viens that you pass through. These will push you in a given direction and you have to correct for them.
- The levels are procedurally generated: As the game goes on, a difficulty variables ticks up which makes more obstacles appear and causes you to fall faster.
- When you collect all of the cancer pieces, game zooms out to reveal person giving you a thumbs up.
- Different levels involve going through different people who are colored differently, with higher difficulty.

NAME OF THE GAME:
Nanodrop

WHAT THE GAME NEEDS:

ART
==================

- The game has a portrait orientation (Tall, not wide. Maybe 800 wide, 1200 tall)

- Assume the robot is around 100x100, cancer cells probably same.

A nanorobot
- Falling animation.
- Limbs flailing around, out of control (When being pushed around by blood viens)
- Victory animation
- Death animation (When falling into bone)

Title screen

Person giving a thumbs up, with insides revealed similarly to the rest of the game (Normal screen zooms out to reveal him.)

Background
- Air before falling into body (Operating room white? Black?)
- Skin to break through
- Tissue (Standard background)

Blood viens flowing either left or right.

Bones (Stick out, take up 2/3rds of the horizontal width at times)

Cancer (It can look weird to make it distinguishable. Glow some strange color?)

A header font and a body font for messages displayed for the game.

MUSIC
=========================
Fast-paced electronic, futury music for the main game.

If someone has time for it, slower pased, electronic futury music for title/menus.

SOUND EFFECTS (Possible ways to get sound effects: Freesound.org, BXFR)
========================
Crashing into bone sound

Dropping sound when flying through air before crashing through skin.

Abstract reward sound for collecting cancer.

Zoom out sound when zooming out to show person giving you thumbs up.

Hose sound when blood veins are pushing against you.

Crash for when you break through the skin initially.

OTHER
===========================
Keep in mind expansions for the game.

I'd like to get a version done in 24 hours that is playtestable if at all possible and have lots of time to respond to playtester feedback

After that's done, I would like to include suggestions for other things to throw into the game.
